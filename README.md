This code classifies genes into core, unique, and accessory categories based on their presence or absence in resistant and susceptible isolates. First, core resistant genes are identified as those present in all resistant isolates, while unique resistant genes are a subset of core resistant genes that are completely absent in susceptible isolates. Similarly, core susceptible genes are found in all susceptible isolates, and unique susceptible genes are those core susceptible genes that do not appear in any resistant isolates. Lastly, accessory genes are defined as those present in some but not all isolates, ensuring they are neither core resistant nor core susceptible genes. This classification helps distinguish genes that are consistently associated with resistance or susceptibility from those that exhibit variable presence across isolates, aiding in the study of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms.
